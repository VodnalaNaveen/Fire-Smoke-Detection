# 🔥 Fire & Smoke Detection Using YOLOv8

A complete end-to-end **Fire and Smoke Detection System** using **YOLOv8**, trained on a **custom Roboflow dataset**. The model supports detection from **images**, **videos**, and **real-time webcam**. This project also includes **ONNX export** for optimized, cross-platform inference on edge devices.

## 📦 Dataset: Roboflow Integration

This project uses a custom-labeled dataset from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) with annotations in YOLOv8 format. Roboflow makes it easy to annotate, version, and export datasets directly into formats supported by modern deep learning frameworks.

## 🧠 Model Training (YOLOv8)

A lightweight YOLOv8 variant (`yolo11n.pt`) was used as the base model. It was trained for 50 epochs on the Roboflow dataset using the YOLOv8 training pipeline. After training, the `best.pt` weights were selected for further inference and deployment.

## 🔄 Export to ONNX

### ❓ Why Export to ONNX?

Exporting your trained model to **ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange)** format unlocks powerful deployment capabilities beyond the training environment. ONNX serves as a bridge across different deep learning frameworks and platforms, offering the following benefits:

 - **🚀 Cross-Platform Compatibility**:
  Run your YOLOv8 model on various platforms like PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenVINO, or even mobile    and embedded devices with ease.

- **⚡ Hardware-Accelerated Inference**:
Use hardware-specific runtimes such as TensorRT, OpenVINO, and ONNX Runtime for faster, optimized model inference.

- **📦 Lightweight & Production-Ready**:
ONNX models are compact, making them ideal for real-time applications and resource-constrained environments.

 - **🔄 Framework Independence**:
Models exported to ONNX can be used outside of the original framework (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) and still work in other environments like OpenVINO, TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, C++, Java, or Web-based apps

In this project, exporting to ONNX ensures that the fire and smoke detection model is portable, efficient, and scalable for real-world use across multiple platforms.

## 🚀 Inference Options

This project supports detection from multiple input sources using the trained YOLOv8 model in ONNX format:

### 📷 Real-Time Webcam Inference

Run the ONNX model directly on your system’s webcam. It captures live frames, performs fire/smoke detection, and displays the annotated output in real time. Optionally, output frames can be saved to disk.

### 🖼️ Image Inference

Detect fire or smoke in static images. The model processes the input image and returns annotated results with bounding boxes and class labels.

### 🎞️ Video Inference

Apply fire and smoke detection to full video files. Each frame is processed individually, and the output can be viewed or saved as a video with annotated detections.
